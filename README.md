# Insurance-Premium-Forecasting
- The Insurance Prediction Project using machine learning is an application of data science to the insurance industry. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, it seeks to predict the likelihood of an individual making an insurance claim based on historical data. 
- This can help insurance companies optimize their operations and provide better services to their customers. The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and building and evaluating machine learning models.
- The goal is to build a highly accurate model that can predict the probability of an individual making an insurance claim with high precision.

## Data
The data used in this project comes from the Kaggle Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noordeen/insurance-premium-prediction)

## Methodology
The project follows the following methodology:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation

Used various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree and random forest to build predictive models.

## Results
The project achieves a high accuracy with R2 Score of 0.85 in predicting whether a policyholder will make an insurance claim or not. Also performed feature importance analysis and provide insights into the most significant factors that influence the likelihood of claims.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the usefulness of machine learning in predicting insurance claims and managing risk. With accurate predictions, insurers can make informed decisions about pricing and policy design, ultimately leading to better outcomes for both the insurer and the policyholder.
